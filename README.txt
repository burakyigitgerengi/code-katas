Code Katas
==========

- This repository contains a collection of programming katas and practice projects designed to improve problem-solving, design thinking, and code clarity.
- The exercises focus on implementing common systems and logic challenges from scratch

Purpose
-------

- To practice translating real-world problems into clean, working code
- To improve algorithmic thinking and implementation skills
- To experiment with different approaches and refactor over time
- To build consistency through deliberate practice

Notes
-------

-This repository is primarily for personal development and for demonstration if requested by recruiters or reviewers.
- These katas are intentionally simple in scope but rich in logic.
- Some solutions may evolve over time as improvements or refactors are applied.
- AI tools, if used, are limited to learning support and conceptual guidance. All implementations are written by me.

This repository reflects ongoing practice and growth as a developer.
Feel free to explore.
